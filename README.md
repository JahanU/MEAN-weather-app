This project was created to further develop my skills with the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack.
Some implementation choices were done to incoperate as much of the stack as possible.

# Features
- Synergy between APIs 
- Dynamic UI based on current location and time
- Geolocation
- Interactive Google Maps
- Feature packed grid with user searches data
- Automated unit testing with Karma, Jasmine and Travis CI

# Stack
- Frontend hosted via Github Pages
- Backend hosted via Heroku
- MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node (MEAN Stack)
