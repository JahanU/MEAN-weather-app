This project was created to further develop my skills with the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack.
Some implementation choices were done to incoperate as much of the stack as possible.

# Features
- Synergy between APIs 
- Dynamic UI based on current location and time
- Geolocation
- Interactive Google Maps

- Automated unit testing with Karma, Jasmine and Travis CI

# Stack
- Frontend hosting via Github Pages
- Backend via Heroku
- MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node (MEAN Stack)
